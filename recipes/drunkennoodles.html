        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Drunken noodles or drunkard noodles is a Thai stir-fried noodle dish similar to phat si-io but spicier.[1] In English texts, it is rendered as pad kee mao, in which phat means 'to stir-fry' and khi mao means 'drunkard'.[4]
            The dish is widely available in restaurants or at street vendors in Thailand but it is also highly popular in the United States, and has become ubiquitous on Thai restaurant menus throughout.[5] 
            Its name refers to it being popular among the inebriated; alcohol is not part of the ingredients or preparation as in drunken chicken.</p>

                    <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
                    
                    <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into strips</li>
                    
                    <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves</li>
                    
                    <li>1 bunch fresh mint leaves</li>
                    
                    <li> 6 teaspoons chile padi (bird's eye chiles), thinly sliced</li>
                    
                    <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
                    
                    <li>2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
                    
                    <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
                    
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    
                    <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                    
                    <li>1 pound chicken thighs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Soak rice noodles in hot water until flexible, 10 to 15 minutes. Occasionally move the noodles around to separate them. Drain the water and cover with a wet paper towel.</li>

                <li>Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, Asian fish sauce, maple syrup, sugar, and water in a small bowl.</li>

                <li>Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok, or large frying pan, over medium-high heat. Stir-fry shallots, chile peppers, and garlic until shallots are soft, about 2 minutes. Move the mixture around the outside of the pan to create a space and add chicken. Sear for 1 minute, then combine with shallot mixture.</li>
                
                <li>Add Chinese broccoli stems and stir-fry until tender, about 2 minutes.</li>

                <li>Add drunken noodle sauce and sliced scallions; mix well and cook until sauce begins to simmer</li>

                <li>Add soaked rice noodles and toss to coat until noodles have absorbed the sauce and are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>

                <li>Stir in Thai basil leaves until wilted. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve.</li>

            </ol>
